# Week2_assignment_wind_forecast

In the improvised version of the Wind Power Generation Analysis, I expanded upon the original notebook by adding deeper insights, clearer visualizations, and refined interpretation. I structured the report into key analytical sectionsâ€”comparing power across locations, examining correlations, and identifying the best site for generation. I included more informative visualizations like time series comparisons and heatmaps, introduced a basic machine learning model (Random Forest) for forecasting, and performed outlier detection to flag anomalies. Each insight is now backed by clear observations and recommendations, making the report more actionable and aligned with real-world decision-making.
